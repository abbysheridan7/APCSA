# Polymorphis
 
  For this exercise, you are given a Team superclass with a BaseballTeam and FootballTeam subclass. Take a moment to examine these classes and the instance variables and methods in each.
  
_focus is on create and using objects using polymorphism_

  ## Instructions
In the Main class, you will see three objects already declared using Team, FootballTeam, and BaseballTeam classses.

For each object use print statements to print out any public method that returns information that is available for that particular object, including the toString.

You should have a total of 16 print statments:
* 6 print statements for dolphins
* 5 print statements for cubs
* 5 print statements for lizard

Once you submit your code, a solution with all the printout statements will be available.
